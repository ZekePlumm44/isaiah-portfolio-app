          Hello, hola, bonjour! I&apos;m a software engineer based out of New
          York with a passion for creative problem solving, beauty in design,
          and engineering first-rate software.

          My deep appreciation for the arts, music and literature has given me a
          unique perspective on software development. I&apos;m a firm believer
          in the power of design and the importance of creating beautiful,
          self-documenting and functional software.

        <p>
          With the advent of AI, I&apos;ve dedicated my time to studying the
          aspects of development that are most likely to be the future of what
          it means to be a software engineer. This includes system design,
          devops fundamentals and where the future of technology is headed.
